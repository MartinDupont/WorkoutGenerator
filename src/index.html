      <p>
        Welcome to my random workout generator. This website will make random barbell workouts for you from
        templates. Just put in some desired search criteria and press go!

      <p>
        As you may have noticed, this page is still in very early development. At the moment there is only
        one available search criteria, which is difficulty. Also, the selection of workouts is a bit limited.
        The workouts are currently all built from templates from the "sheiko" program, named after the russian
        powerlifting trainer. So the workouts are difficult, focusing on the big lifts, and training primarily strength.
        I hope to add some more variety to the workout database soon.
